**Description**
Rara is really waiting for the Reputation TV to be released. Her favorite song from the
Reputation album is Delicate with its iconic chant of "1 2 3, LET’S GO-". Oops, the real
word is quite inappropriate, so she changed it to "SWITCH" instead. Since Rara loves
data structure, she wants to program a code that can swap nodes in a linked list.

<br><br>
Input Format
You are given a list with value (integer) until -1 and an integer k. You need to swap
the values of the k-th node from the beginning and the k-th node from the end of
the list. The list is 1-indexed.

<br><br>
Output Format<br>
Print the modified list after swapping the nodes.<br>
Constraints<br>
- The number of nodes in the list is n
- 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 1000
- 1 ≤ value ≤ 100


**Example 1** <br>
Input <br>
1 2 3 4 5 <br>
-1 <br>
2 <br>
Output <br>
1 4 3 2 5 <br> 
**Explanation 1** <br>
Since the 2 <br>
th value from the beginning is 2 and the 2 <br>
th value from the end is 4, we swap those nodes. <br>
Example 2 <br>
Input <br>
12 10 13 17 18 20 23 27 30 24 <br>
-1 <br>
7 <br>
Output <br>
12 10 13 23 18 20 17 27 30 24 <br>
**Explanation 2** <br>
Since the 7 <br>
th value from the beginning is 23 and the 7 <br>
th value from the end is 17, we swap those nodes.
